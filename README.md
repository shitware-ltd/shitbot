# Shitware Ltd Discord Bot

### This bot is hand crafted using PHP. It is *fast enough*. You should expect nothing less.

## Notes:
- `PHP >= 8.1` is required.
- All http calls are handled through coroutines, thus non-blocking. This **php** bot can indeed handle many user commands at the same time.
- The use emojis for reactions inside the [Emoji](src/Support/Emoji.php) support class are from a private server, and will not work for you. You must swap the emojis out yourself.
